# NeckUp
An Android app that trains people to correctly hold their phones to relieve neck pain

## Getting Started
## Introduction

NeckUp was founded during [Philly Startup Weekend 2018](http://communities.techstars.com/usa/phlsw/startup-weekend). It is an interactive and non-invasive tool helping users develop muscle memory for correct posture while they go about their regular routines. 

To do this, NeckUp app runs in the back in the background on the users' phone, dimming the screen whenever they hold the phone in bad posture, reminding them to hold the phone upright to reduce neck pain.
